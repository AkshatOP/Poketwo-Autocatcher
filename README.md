Once you have done that hit `npm install` in console.

## **Specific Channel Support**
If you want to run the bot so that it catches only in specific channels then Head over to LINE 17 of #index.js and fill the array with channel IDs of those channel you want to catch in.
*Leave it like [ ] if you don't want this feature* 

## **Help**

## **Captcha**
If Captcha comes , The bot stops it's catching and goes to a short sleep. You can solve the captcha from any ID and then use the command `$captcha_completed` for the bot to wake up

## **Config.json**
After That enter in the following fields in **Config.json**:

##### <b>TOKEN</b>:
Paste in your discord account's user token. You can find instructions on this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W9tAEsK7RM)
*CAUTION*
If you are using repl.it and don't want your token to be leaked. Follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKlv__1OoGc) to secure your token and apply that fix in line 130 of index.js. 

##### <b>spamChannelID</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to spam as well as catch Pokétwo spawns. Make sure you paste this carefully, as If you set it to the wrong channel it will spam and catch there.

##### <b>logChannelID</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to log the pokemons caught in a desired channel of yours.

##### <b>errorChannelID</b>:
This will allow the bot to use your preferred channel to log the errors of code in a desired channel of yours.

##### <b>OwnerID</b>:
This will be the user-ID of the account controlling the bot (for using "$say" and "$captcha_completed" command)  

##### <b>ocrSpaceApiKey</b>:
This is the MOST IMPORTANT part. You have to create an ocrSpace account and put it's API key. Click [here](https://ocr.space/ocrapi/freekey) to get free API-KEY

After you've entered that in, the autocatcher should start successfully. (if not, check if you have entered in the right fields)

## **DISCLAIMER**

Please note that self botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and being discovered using a self bot may result in your account being banned. To avoid this, keep knowledge of your self bot to a minimum and use a throwaway account. I am not responsible for any accounts lost due to the self bot. I also recommend checking the self bot channel's messages occasionally to see if Pokétwo has sent a captcha. **If it has, it would be a good idea to solve it.**
